Simple hash table implementation in Rust. Uses open addressing for collision resolution (even though open addressing is a stupid idea). Written for use with my crafting interpeters tutorial implementation. 

Named caffeine because the night I made this, I accidentally had so much Coffee that my hands were literally shaking.

	<summary>The story</summarY>
	What happened is I ran out of coffee filters and decided to just make coffee without one and hope it would be fine. When I drank it I started tweaking instantly. It was so bad I had a hard time typing and even focusing on what I was doing lmao
